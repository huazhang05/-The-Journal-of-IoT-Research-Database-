According to the given information, our team designed the Entity
Relationship (E/R) diagram, shows entity types, relationships, attributes, key
attributes, cardinalities, and participation constraints. Also, normalize the entities
and include the steps of normalization process (to 3NF), After that we create
database schema using SQL DDL statements, show how they enforced the
constraints implied by their logical design, identify any constraints that are not
captured by the ER diagram, and we also apply advanced database concepts such
as triggers to maintain data integrity, indexes, views, and procedures to improve
system performance.
